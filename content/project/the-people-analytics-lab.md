**What is the People Analytics Lab?**

It is an applied social science lab is in the tradition of industrial and organizational psychology (see [siop.org](https://www.siop.org) for more details on the discipline). In the lab, students can find opportunities to both learn and apply psychological theory to solve a variety of problems in organizational life. It is also an opportunity to learn how to apply data analytics and project management tools, such as [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com), [Slack](https://slack.com), and [Trello](https://slack.com). We've had students participate in our lab from many disciplinary backgrounds and from various educational levels (e.g., high school, undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral). No post-docs yet (but give us some time)!.

**Why join our lab?**

We created the People Analytics Lab at NSU to give students the opportunity to do research that helps make organizational life not suck. We hope that the experiences give you a spring board to start your graduate education in I/O psych or a related discipline (e.g., getting your MBA). Importantly, many of the activities in the lab are conducted virtually, meaning that students don't have to be from our institution or near Thibodaux, LA. Indeed, we've had students participate from other schools as well (e.g., Villanova University, Rutgers Business School). Keep in mind that our research focuses on many areas but do include specifically (1) the impact of performance feedback on future performance, (2) gender-related leadership issues, (3) personality in the workplace, (4) workplace ethics, and (5) organizational research methods (e.g., method variance and open science in I/O psych).

**What are we looking for in a collaborator?**

As PAL is an open-science [co-laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboratory), we're always looking for new team members. The best fit are individuals who:

* Enjoy working with others in a team context
* Are interested in using data to better understand people in organizational settings to make work not suck
* Are willing to acclimate to data analytics tools for working in an open science environment (e.g., R, GitHub, Open Science Framework) 
* Either have or are interested in pursuing a graduate degree in the social sciences, or would like to learn more about people analytics! 

PAL collaborators may work on any of the following tasks:

* Building and reviewing surveys using Qualtrics
* Analyzing survey data
* Reviewing the literature on a given topic
* Programming for open-science projects (e.g., using RStudio, GitHub, and using the Open Science Framework resources
* Learn how to different good versus poor quality survey responses
* Support Project Leaders who are running, monitoring, or automating online and live studies on campus or through Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk)
* Help lab managers organize the lab
* Participate in regular lab meetings

More advanced students will be tasked with helping Dr. Castille and his colleagues lead research projects, which can include:

* Developing relationships with community and local organizational leaders
* Serving as a liaison between lab managers and project associates
* Conducting systematic reviews of the literature as needed to inform client decision-making
* Manage data collection using MTurk or Qualtrics
* Update projects on the Open Science Framework
* Help prepare manuscripts for presentation and publication

**How to join our lab?**

To qualify for our lab, you must:

* Be willing to dedicate a minimum of 5 hours per week to lab duties. If a graduate student, be willing to dedicate 10 hours (2.5 days) per week to lab management and research. Must also be willing to participate in semi-regular readings and lab discussions (1+ hours/week) related to current research projects.
* Have a GPA of at least 3.0.
* (Not required, but ideal) Have received basic statistical and/or computer coding training.

If you qualify, then please feel free to apply by doing the following:

1. *Send an email to Dr. Castille (email below) expressing your interest in the lab and what you want to get out of it.* Why do you want to be in the lab? What is the motivation? If you want to go on to grad school and need research experience, let us know? If it just sounds cool and you want to see what it is like, that is great? Just make sure you write something professional (that is really important).

2. *Send a resume and unofficial transcript that details what you might be able to contribute to the lab.* No doubt you have experiences or prior coursework that might make for meaningful contributions to the lab. Call attention to this in your letter of interest and make sure we can see this in your resume and transcript. We'd also like to know what your GPA is.

If you have any more questions, then please don't hesitate to reach out to Dr. Christopher Castille (christopher.castille@nicholls.edu) and ask for more information.

We hope to hear from you soon!
