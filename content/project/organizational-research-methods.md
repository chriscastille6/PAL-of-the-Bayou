My interest in research methods splits into two areas. First, I'm interested in furthering evidence-based human resource and management practices, which is a movement that encourages evidence-based decision-making in organizational life, or the conscientious and judicious use of the best available evidence (e.g., scientific facts, professional expertise, organizational data, and stakeholder values and concerns). The second and related area concerns the application and adoption of open science practices. How can we make evidence-based decisions unless we have all the available evidence?
