Individual differences refer to to stable qualities of indivdiuals (e.g., intelligence and personality traits). I focus primarily on personality traits scommonly understood from the perspective of the five factor model of personality, which views individuals as falling somewhere on five broad traits: neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Broadly speaking, I aim to know the implications of these indivdiual differences for organizational life (e.g., predicting unethical or counterproductive behavior at work) as well as life in general.
