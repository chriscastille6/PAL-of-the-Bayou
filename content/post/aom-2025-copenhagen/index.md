AOM Goes Global

The Academy of Management's 85th Annual Meeting (AOM 2025) marked a historic milestone as the first time the conference was held outside North America. It was also my first time presenting at AOM! From July 25-29, 2025, nearly 13,000 management scholars, practitioners, and students gathered at Copenhagen's Bella Convention Center to engage with cutting-edge research across the field. It is my field's leading academic conference and I am proud to have represented Nicholls State University at this venue. 

This international expansion underscores the Academy's commitment to building a truly global, inclusive research community. The program featured over 5,000 sessions and symposia, along with 900 poster presentations, addressing contemporary topics ranging from artificial intelligence and entrepreneurship to corporate social responsibility, work-life balance, hybrid work arrangements, and employee wellbeing.

I was fortunate enough to have two presentations accepted and, given my work reputation for working in open science and big team science, was invited to another join another two sessions. These sessions are below.

### Enhancing Research Credibility & Transparency (PDW #21939)

**Saturday, July 26, 2025 | 11:00-13:00 CEST | Bella Center, MR5**

Organized by Roman Briker (Maastricht University), Fabiola Heike Gerpott (WHU Otto Beisheim School of Management), and Jost Sieweke (Vrije University Amsterdam), this Professional Development Workshop directly addressed the credibility and integrity crisis in management research.

### Navigating Large-Scale Collaborations: Mega-studies, Crowdsourced Research & Massive Meta-Analyses (#11625)

**Sunday, July 27, 2025 | 10:00-12:00 CEST | Bella Center, Hall B – B6-m3**

Organized by Bart De Jong and Kevin M. Kniffin, this PDW explored the "science of team science" and strategies for managing large-scale collaborations. Presenters included Kevin M. Kniffin, Katherine Milkman, George Banks, Piers Steel, and Bart De Jong, with Matthew A. Cronin serving as discussant.

*Note: I was invited to attend this session last-minute as an observer, which provided valuable insights into the coordination challenges and opportunities of large-scale collaborative research.*

### Collaboration Initiative for Doctoral Students: ARIM Symposium (#20376)

**Sunday, July 27, 2025 | 12:00-13:30 CEST | Bella Center, Hall C – C4-m3**

This symposium introduced the Advancement of Replications Initiative in Management (ARIM), which I'm proud to be part of alongside Andreas Schwab, Xavier Martin, and William Obenauer. The session featured panelists Yannick Griep, Gerdien Sonneveld, Corentin Hericher, and Caitlin C. Belfiore.

ARIM coordinates joint execution and publication of multi-study replications by teams of doctoral students, faculty mentors, and replication-minded scholars. The initiative addresses a critical gap in management research: the need for systematic replication to build evidence-based management theory.

### Enhancing Model Precision: Advanced Solutions for Common Challenges (#19189)

**Tuesday, July 29, 2025 | 08:30-10:00 CEST | Bella Center, Hall C – C2-m4**

This symposium addressed critical methodological challenges in structural equation modeling (SEM) and latent variable modeling, featuring presentations by Andrew A. Hanna, Larry J. Williams, and Jinsoo Choi. I participated alongside Steven Culpepper, Bo Zhang, Susu Zhang, and Yonguk Park.

I must credit my coauthor, Dr. Larry Williams, for his exceptional work advancing the RMSEA-P. **Model Selection Using RMSEA-P Fit Index**. I contributed here by helping Larry make this work independently reproducible. 

## Cross-Cutting Themes: Building a Stronger Research Community

Several interconnected themes emerged across these sessions, reflecting broader trends in management research:

### Transparency & Credibility
Both the research credibility PDW and the ARIM replication symposium emphasized that transparent methods and systematic replication are foundational to trustworthy science. These sessions demonstrated how management research is actively responding to calls for greater robustness and reproducibility.

### Methodological Rigor
The latent variable modeling symposium complemented the credibility theme by addressing technical challenges that, if unresolved, can undermine the validity of findings. The session provided practical tools for enhancing model precision and resolving common methodological issues.

### Collaboration & Scale
The mega-studies PDW and ARIM initiative illustrated how team science and large-scale collaboration can advance knowledge. They also highlighted practical considerations for researchers joining large teams, including coordination strategies and credit allocation protocols.

### Community Building
Several sessions aimed to build research communities—the "credibility community" for transparency practices, the ARIM network for replications, and collaborative networks for large-scale projects. This reflects a growing trend toward collective effort and shared norms in management research.

## Conclusion

AOM 2025 Copenhagen represented a significant milestone in the Academy of Management's history as the first conference held outside North America. The event brought together nearly 13,000 management scholars, practitioners, and students to engage with cutting-edge research across diverse methodological and topical areas.

The sessions documented here—focusing on research credibility, replication initiatives, advanced methodological techniques, and large-scale collaboration—demonstrate the field's commitment to building more robust, transparent, and impactful management research. These initiatives reflect broader trends toward collective effort, shared norms, and enhanced methodological rigor in the management research community.
