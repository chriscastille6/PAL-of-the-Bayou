We conduct research studies to advance understanding of people analytics, organizational behavior, and workplace psychology. Your participation helps us generate insights that benefit both science and practice.

**Note:** Most of our studies are currently available only to members of Nicholls State University (faculty, staff, and students). We are actively seeking industry partners for some studies—see details below.

## Current Studies

<details>
<summary><strong>Occupational Fit Study: Replication and Extension of Liu et al.</strong> <em>(Click to expand)</em></summary>

<div style="margin-top: 1rem; padding-left: 1rem; border-left: 3px solid #2c3e50;">

**Status:** In preparation (IRB review pending)

**Eligibility:** Nicholls State University faculty, staff, and students

This study examines how efficiently students choose their plan of study at Nicholls State University, where some efficiency gains may be possible. We are investigating the role of coursework (e.g., assessment activities in UNIV 101) in helping students identify academic programs that align with their strengths and interests. The study also explores factors that influence students' decisions about whether to pursue graduate studies.

**Participation involves:** Completing assessments related to personality, interests, values, and academic fit.

<summary><strong>Total Rewards Optimization Study</strong> <em>(Click to expand)</em></summary>

<div style="margin-top: 1rem; padding-left: 1rem; border-left: 3px solid #2c3e50;">

**Status:** Ongoing

**Eligibility:** Nicholls State University students (especially those in peer teaching contexts)

**Seeking:** Employers and industry partners

We are testing whether students undergoing peer teaching in economics and human resources can more clearly see how their studies are interrelated and how economic theories they are learning can be applied in related areas (e.g., HR).

**For Industry Partners:** This study offers a unique opportunity to test different compensation and benefits packages with graduating students. You can learn more about what our graduating students are looking for from prospective employers and, more importantly, what will help retain them. Participating employers benefit from insights into student preferences and can inform their recruitment and retention strategies.

**Participation involves:** Students complete assessments and choice experiments related to compensation and benefits preferences. Industry partners can test specific reward packages and receive aggregated insights about student preferences.

<summary><strong>AI-Based Psychological Coaching Tool Development</strong> <em>(Click to expand)</em></summary>

<div style="margin-top: 1rem; padding-left: 1rem; border-left: 3px solid #2c3e50;">

**Status:** In preparation

**Eligibility:** Nicholls State University students

We are developing an AI-based psychological coaching tool that helps students navigate complex social challenges they naturally face in their professional studies (e.g., navigating conflict, managing team dynamics, handling difficult conversations).

The tool takes as input students' profiles on:
- Emotional intelligence
- General intelligence
- Personality traits
- Interests
- Values

It then provides personalized guidance to help students use their strengths appropriately in interpersonal settings and develop strategies for managing challenging social situations.

**Participation involves:** Completing a battery of psychological assessments and receiving personalized coaching feedback based on your profile.

<summary><strong>Emotional Intelligence and the Dunning-Kruger Effect</strong> <em>(Click to expand)</em></summary>

<div style="margin-top: 1rem; padding-left: 1rem; border-left: 3px solid #2c3e50;">

**Status:** Ongoing

**Eligibility:** Nicholls State University faculty, staff, and students

This study examines the relationship between emotional intelligence and the Dunning-Kruger effect—the phenomenon where individuals with low ability in a domain tend to overestimate their ability, while those with high ability may underestimate their competence.

**Participation involves:** Completing assessments of emotional intelligence and self-assessment measures to examine how accurately individuals can evaluate their own emotional competencies.

**Status:** Ongoing

**Partnership:** Raymond Lee at Clocking Out

**Eligibility:** Professionals seeking career transitions

We are partnering with Raymond Lee at Clocking Out to build a comprehensive assessment that will be integrated into a coaching process designed to help professionals navigate important career transitions. This assessment-based coaching program provides structured support for individuals making significant career changes, helping them understand their strengths, values, interests, and how these align with potential new career paths.

The assessment serves as the foundation for personalized coaching sessions that guide professionals through the career transition process, from initial exploration to successful transition into new roles or industries.

**Status:** Ongoing

**Partnership:** [Bayou SHRM](https://www.bayoushrm.org)

**Eligibility:** Top HR students at Nicholls State University and experienced HR professionals in the Bayou SHRM network

We are partnering with Bayou SHRM to build a mentoring program that connects our top HR students with experienced, local professionals. This program is designed to help spread evidence-based HR best practices from experienced practitioners to up-and-coming talent.

The mentoring program focuses on high-performance work practices—including selective hiring, extensive training, performance-based pay, and employee involvement—that have been shown to improve organizational performance. Recent meta-analytic evidence indicates these practices are particularly effective in small to medium enterprises, which make up the bulk of our local organizations.

**For Students:** Receive one-on-one mentoring from experienced HR professionals, learn about evidence-based HR practices, and gain insights into real-world application of HR strategies.

**For Professionals:** Share your expertise with the next generation of HR talent, contribute to the development of evidence-based HR practices in our region, and help shape the future of the HR profession.

**Participation involves:** Students and professionals are matched based on interests and goals. The program includes regular mentoring sessions, opportunities to discuss high-performance work practices, and collaborative learning experiences.
