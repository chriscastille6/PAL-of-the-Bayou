## Technical Requirements
- **Resolution**: Minimum 1920x1080, preferably 2560x1440
- **Format**: PNG or JPG
- **File naming**: Use descriptive names (e.g., `phase1_height_weight.png`)
- **Browser**: Use Chrome or Firefox for best rendering
- **Window size**: Full browser window, no bookmarks bar visible

## Screenshot List

### 1. App Main Interface

**Purpose**: Show the overall app layout and design
**Instructions**:
- Open the app at the beginning (before any interaction)
- Capture the full interface showing:
  - Title "Guess the Correlation"
  - Subtitle "Structured Learning: Intuitive → Medical → Business & Organizational Psychology"
  - Phase indicator (should show "Intuitive" phase)
  - Input area for correlation guess
  - Generate Plot button
  - Submit Guess button
- Ensure the phase indicator shows the green "Intuitive" styling

### 2. Phase 1: Intuitive Examples
**File**: `phase1_height_weight.png`
**Purpose**: Demonstrate the first learning phase with obvious relationships
**Instructions**:
- Navigate to Phase 1 (Intuitive)
- Enter a correlation guess (e.g., 0.65)
- Click "Generate Plot"
- Submit the guess
- Capture the scatter plot showing:
  - Height vs. Weight data points
  - Your prediction trend line (black)
  - True correlation line (green)
  - Correlation value displayed (should be around 0.67)
- Include the feedback message showing accuracy

### 3. Phase 2: Medical Interventions
**File**: `phase2_medical_example.png`
**Purpose**: Show surprising small effects of medical treatments
**Instructions**:
- Navigate to Phase 2 (Medical)
- Choose an example like "Aspirin consumption" vs "Reduced risk of death by heart attack"
- Enter a guess (students typically overestimate - try 0.30)
- Generate plot and submit
- Capture the scatter plot showing:
  - Very weak correlation (r ≈ 0.02)
  - Wide scatter of points
  - Clear gap between prediction and reality
- Include the learning message about medical intervention effects

### 4. Phase 3: Business & Organizational Psychology
**File**: `phase3_business_example.png`
**Purpose**: Demonstrate business-relevant correlations from Meyer et al. (2001)
**Instructions**:
- Navigate to Phase 3 (Business & Organizational Psychology)
- Choose "Conscientiousness test scores" vs "Job proficiency"
- Enter a guess (e.g., 0.40)
- Generate plot and submit
- Capture the scatter plot showing:
  - Moderate correlation (r = 0.23)
  - Business context in variable names
  - Real sample size displayed
- Include the context message about business psychology research

### 5. Phase 4: Mixed Challenges
**File**: `phase4_mixed_example.png`
**Purpose**: Show application across different domains
**Instructions**:
- Navigate to Phase 4 (Mixed)
- Choose any example
- Enter a guess and submit
- Capture the scatter plot
- Include the mixed challenges context message

### 6. BESD Visualization
**File**: `besd_visualization.png`
**Purpose**: Show the Binomial Effect Size Display
**Instructions**:
- After submitting a guess, navigate to the "Effect Size (BESD)" tab
- Ensure the title shows "How X Correlates to Y" (not "Impact of X on Y")
- Verify y-axis shows "Probability of having above average Y (%)"
- Capture the bar chart showing:
  - Two bars: "No" and "Yes" (for above median X)
  - Percentage values on each bar
  - Clear title with correlation value
- Include the BESD explanation text below the chart

### 7. Smooth Transitions
**File**: `smooth_transitions.gif` (or series of PNGs)
**Purpose**: Demonstrate the smooth elastic transitions
**Instructions**:
- Start with one correlation value
- Slowly move the correlation slider
- Capture the smooth animation as points move
- Show the elastic transition effect
- Create either a GIF or series of 3-4 screenshots showing progression

### 8. Hover Information
**File**: `hover_information.png`
**Purpose**: Show interactive hover details
**Instructions**:
- Hover over a data point in any scatter plot
- Capture the tooltip showing:
  - Variable names and values
  - Sample size information
  - Formatted hover text
- Ensure the hover text is clear and readable

### 9. Trend Line Visualization
**File**: `trend_line_example.png`
**Purpose**: Show trend line features
**Instructions**:
- Check the "Show trend line" option
- Generate a plot with both prediction and true correlation lines
- Capture showing:
  - Black line for prediction
  - Green line for true correlation
  - Legend showing both lines
  - Clear distinction between lines

### 10. Feedback and Scoring
**File**: `feedback_scoring.png`
**Purpose**: Show the feedback system
**Instructions**:
- Submit a guess that's close to correct (within 0.05)
- Capture the feedback message showing:
  - "Correct!" message
  - Accuracy statistics
  - Learning message for the phase
  - Progress tracking
